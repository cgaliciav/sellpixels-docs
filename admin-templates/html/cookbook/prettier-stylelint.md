# Prettier / Stylelint

Prettier is an opinionated code formatter. It enforces a consistent style by parsing your code and re-printing it with its own rules that take the maximum line length into account, wrapping code when necessary.

Run `npm run prettier`

Stylelint is a mighty, modern linter that helps you avoid errors and enforce conventions in your styles.

Run `npm run stylelint`
